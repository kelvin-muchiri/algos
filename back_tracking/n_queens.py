"""
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
"""

"""
Notes:

- We continue the process until all queens are placed
- If no safe place is left, we change the position of the previously placed queen
- Any cell (k,l) will be diagonal to cell (i,j) if k + l = i + j, or k - l = i - j
